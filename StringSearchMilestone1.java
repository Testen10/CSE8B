 The main method should expect from 1 to 3 command-line arguments:

    $ java StringSearch "<file>" "<query>" "<transform>"
 The overall goal of StringSearch is to take a file of text, search for lines in the file based on some criteria, then print out the matching lines after transforming them somehow.

 The <thing> syntax means, as usual, that we will be describing what kinds of syntax can go in each position in more detail.

 <file> should be a path to a file. Weâ€™ve included two for you to test on with examples below. It is recommended to make a few of your own files and try them out as well.
  <query> describes criteria for which lines in the file to print.
 <transform> describes how to change each line in the file before printing.
